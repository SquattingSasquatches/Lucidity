			Welcome to the Lucidity Project! Lucidity aims to be the premier app for classroom communication. Planned features include:<br></br>
			<ul>
			<li>It will allow teachers to communicate easily with their classes. </li>
			<li>Teachers will be able to push digital handouts to students' phones. Students will then be able to fill out the handouts and turn them back in to the teacher.</li>
			<li>Teachers will be able to send out notifications of assignments and tests. This will hopefully be a better alternative to e-mail which can get cluttered up for multiple classes.</li>
			<li>Students will be able to sign in to a specific class period or be marked absent by the teacher.</li>
			<li>Students will be able to indicate their understanding of the discussed material through the app. The information will be anonymously submitted and sent to a dynamically generated graph aggregating the understanding of the class as a whole.</li>
			<li>Students and Teachers will be able to use this app instead of other specialized devices decreasing the cost of getting an education.</li>
			
			</ul>
